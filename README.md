# Godot3DWaterExample
A simple 3D water example for Godot game engine.

The technique is inspired by GPUGem here: http://http.developer.nvidia.com/GPUGems2/gpugems2_chapter19.html

It uses a normal map to displace a (by default) skybox or the screen texture(read comments in code). 
The result looks similar to a refraction.
